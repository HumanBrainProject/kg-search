# Permissions
The following special rules apply for permissions:

- released instances which are originating from a public space are made available for everyone (no authentication required)
- instances "in progress" e.g. for early-preview are made available for those users which are member of the collab "kg-search-in-progress-"
- live instances are following the rules of the permission management on the KG Core (invited users are allowed to see the instance). This is true for everything except for files which are made available to any user who has read access (standard or invited) to the corresponding dataset for technical reasons.
