          "value": "The brain acts on the environment by gathering multisensory information. The information from multiple senses is combined effectively in the mammalian brain to form one unified perceptual experience. This process of multisensory integration has been linked to multimodal activity in sensory areas of the neocortex, but the precise mechanisms and relevant areas are still not fully elucidated. In this work, we imaged neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) and Anterolateral visual cortex (AL) of the mouse during a visual, auditory and audiovisual detection task. Animals were trained to respond by licking a lickspout if a stimulus was perceived, and withhold licking if there was no stimulus.  This paradigm provides us with the chance to see enhanced responses in multisensory conditions. The task information is saved in MATLAB files holding relevant information such as animals response information (such as correct/incorrect, response time) and stimulus information (such as modality, contrast or loudness). Two-photon data were collected and processed; individual cells’ dF/F traces have been extracted and are presented in the same MATLAB files (see Usage notes for more details about the data layout). With these data, we found that AL neurons are more sensitive to weak stimuli compared to V1. Both V1 and AL cells showed modulation of visual responses in the multisensory condition, meaning the addition of an auditory stimulus to the visual one changed the cell responses. For multisensory stimuli, area AL showed stronger responses when the animal reported to have seen a stimulus, versus when it did not. Results indicate area AL correlated more with multisensory detection than V1."

Most studies have examined resting state activity throughout the brain using MRI scans, or observed local co-variations in activity by recording from a small number of electrodes. We carried out electrophysiological recordings from over a thousand chronically implanted electrodes in the visual cortex of non-human primates, yielding a resting state dataset with unprecedentedly high channel counts and spatiotemporal resolution. Such signals could be used to observe brain waves across larger regions of cortex, offering a temporally detailed picture of brain activity. In this paper, we provide the dataset, describe the raw and processed data formats and data acquisition methods, and indicate how the data can be used to yield new insights into the ‘background’ activity that influences the processing of visual information in our brain."

In the current work, we have investigated the genetic basis of mirror aggression by using a classic forward genetics approach - selective breeding for high- and low mirror aggression zebrafish (HAZ and LAZ). For this AB wild-type zebrafish were characterised for their response to the mirror image and both aggressive and non-aggressive fish were inbred over generations. RNAseq analysis revealed that around 500 protein-encoding genes with diverse important biological functions were differentially expressed between the most aggressive HAZ and the least aggressive LAZ, suggesting a strong genetic contribution to this phenotype. DAVID pathway analysis showed that a number of diverse pathways are enriched in HAZ over LAZ including pathways related to immune function, oxidation-reduction processes and cell signalling. In addition, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified 12 modules of highly correlated genes that were significantly associated with aggression duration and/or experimental group."

We compared the cortical activity dynamics following whisker stimulation in two conditions: deep and medium anesthesia in the same chronically implanted mice. Combining level-dependent modulation of slow wave, optical imaging and whisker stimulation, it was possible to perform large-scale spatial correlation between cortical regions during a response evoked by sensory stimulation. Moreover, as recordings are saved as tiff files, it is easy to work on them using Matlab or ImageJ programs.

To validate these atlases, we generated 15 volumetric images of C57BL/6J wild-type mouse pup brains at postnatal day 0 (10 male, 5 female) using lightsheet microscopy. Mouse brains were cleared using the CUBIC clearing technique given its balance of transparency, morphological preservation, and ease of handling. SYTO 16 nuclear dye labeled cells throughout each brain, while 5x objective magnification provided cellular resolution. We registered our 3D reconstructed E18.5 atlas [(DOI: 10.25493/X4ZT-ARE)](https://doi.org/10.25493%2FX4ZT-ARE) to each of these brains for quantitative cellular analysis by region.

From a large cohort of healthy individuals [Nooner et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2012.00152), we selected a subgroup of 466 participants with good quality preprocessed T1-weighted MR-scans, using CAT12 toolbox [http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/](http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/), and available scores in a broad range of psychometric measures covering multiple cognitive domains (such as attention, episodic memory), personality and emotion scores. The preprocessed individual GMV maps, their corresponding psychometric scores and the regions of the Julich-Brain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas are then entered into the pyJUSBB tool [https://github.com/shahrzadkh/pyJUSBB/](https://github.com/shahrzadkh/pyJUSBB/), where non-parametric partial correlations between variability in average GMV in each of the brain regions and each of the 48 behavioral scores are assessed and ranked to create the behavioral profile of each region. The stability of each association is demonstrated as 95% Bootstrap confidence interval (10000 times)."

This approach allows quantitative assessment of morphometric parameters of synaptic inputs along the whole length of dendrites originating from the parent soma. Adjoining sections always have cut cell bodies which appear on the facing surface of both sections. Using the mirror-technique, in one of the sections the histochemical marker of the GABAergic subtype, parvalbumin (PV) was revealed. After identifying immuno-positive neurons which were cut on the surface the remaining part of the very same cell bodies were identified on the surface of the adjoining section. Here we provide quantitative data on the synaptic coverage of one dendrite segments belonging to one PV immuno-positive IN. The spatial distribution of asymmetric and symmetric synapses, surface area and volume of the presynaptic boutons, area extent of the active zones and morphometric parameters of synaptic vesicles were determined."
